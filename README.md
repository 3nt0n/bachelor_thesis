**Experiments:** Training data of the environments

**Screenshots, Videos,Plots:** The plots, screenshots and videos (.mkv) for the experiments

**Learning Notes:** Some Notes I made while doing the thesis, mainly to understand the gym and baselines environments better and setting things up. Might be interesting if you are new to OpenAI gym and baselines and have struggles to set it up.

**Environments:**

 Standard Environments by OpenAI:

  -FetchReach-v1
  -FetchPush-v1
  -FetchSlide-v1
  -FetchPickAndPlace-v1


 FetchSlideball Environment:
 
  -FetchSlideball-v1: Same as FetchSlide, but with ball
  
  -FetchSlideball-v2: Same as FetchSlideball-v1, but with bigger distance -> fails

  -FetchSlideball-v3: Same as FetchSlideball-v2, but with 10% friction

  -FetchSlideball-v4: Same as FetchSlideball-v2, but with 50% friction -> fails

  -FetchSlideball-v6: Same as FetchSlideball-v2, but with 25% friction


 FetchToss Environment:

  -FetchPickAndPlaceball-v1: FetchPickAndPlace-v1, but with a ball

  -FetchToss-v1: Environment FetchPickAndPlaceball-v1 changed to contain a box and the goal is in the box. ->fails

  -FetchToss-v2: Same as FetchToss-v1, but with easier box and some friction added (in v1 the ball would have been stuck where it landed because of missing friction) ->fails

  -FetchToss-v3: Same as FetchToss-v2, but with doubled steps per episode ->fails

  -FetchToss-v4: Same as FetchToss-v3, but the weight of the ball is only 1% -> fails

  -FetchTosscube-v1: Same as FetchToss-v1, but with a cube -> fails

  -FetchToss-v5: Not like v1. Weight of the ball is still 1%, no friction, normal 50 steps per episode. 
                 The goal is distributed as follows: 75% like FetchPickAndPlace , 25% it is on a higher table (0.5 high, normal table is 0.4 high) to force it to toss -> it works

  -FetchToss-v6: Same as v5, but with friction of the ball added

  -FetchToss-v7: Same as v6, but with longer higher table

  -FetchToss-v8: Same as v5, but with longer table and 10x more weight on the ball

  -FetchToss-v9: Same as v5, but with longer table and 10x less weight on the ball

  -FetchToss-v10: Same as v5, but with longer table and same weight

  -FetchToss-v11: Same as v5, but with the higher table being at 1.0 high 

  -FetchToss-v12: Same as v5, but with the higher table being at 0.85 high

  -FetchToss-v13: Same as v5, but with the higher table being at 0.7 high

  -FetchToss-v14: Same as v5, but with 10x more weight on the ball

  -FetchToss-v15: Same as v5, but with 10x less weight on the ball

Each except for FetchSlideball-v2 was trained for 50 epochs. following code was used for training:

mpirun -np 10 python -m baselines.run --alg=her --env=<environment> --num_env=2 --num_timesteps=<numberneededfor50epochs(usually250000)> --save_path=<savepath> --log_path=<logpath>

Plappert et. al used 19 CPUs in their paper instead of only 10.

*Idea behind environments:*

1. First I tried the benchmarks to test OpenAI gym and baselines, and have them for comparison

2. FetchSlideball is a simpler environment than FetchToss to test using a ball and changing distance

3. FetchSlideball-v1 changes FetchSlide-v1 by using a ball instead of a cylinder -> ball performs better

4. FetchSlideball-v2 - v6 are tries to use a bigger distance (doubled the distance) -> can learn for v4 and v6 to slide the ball in the right direction, but not to stop it precisely at the goal.

5. FetchToss is the aim of the thesis

6. FetchPickAndPlaceball-v1 changes FetchPickAndPlace-v1 by using a ball instead of a cube -> ball performs worse

7. FetchToss-v1 - v4 and FetchTosscube are tries to make tossing work. It failed, because the goal was *only* in the box. To learn something, all steps in between have to be included as goals. FetchPickAndPlaceAir-v1 is FetchPickAndPlace but without the goals on the ground, which shows, that the robotic arm doesn't learns to pick up without goals on the ground.

8. That's why FetchToss-v5 has the goal distributed to being to 75% FetchPickAndPlace to learn how to pick up the ball first and to 25% the goal will be on a higher table (height 0.5, lower table is only 0.4) to learn how to toss -> it works.

Toss-v5 will be the base for each of the next versions.

9. With friction: Toss-v6, Also increasing the the tossing distance with Toss-v7

10. Without friction, only changing weight: Toss-v14 (10x more weight on the ball), Toss-v15 (10x less weight on the ball)

11. Without friction, longer tossing distance to try to tos farther: Toss-v8 (10x more weight on the ball), Toss-v9 (10x less weight on the ball), Toss-v10

12. Without friction, higher table to try to toss up: Toss-v11 (height: 1.0), Toss-v12 (height: 0.85), Toss-v13 (height: 0.7)

13. -> Tossing up and tossing higher distances don't really work. 
    Tossing in general is possible.

**How to run the experiment results:**

Go to the Environments/gym folder and run "pip install -e ." in the terminal.
Then go to the Environments/baselines folder and also run "pip install -e ."

Then run "python -m baselines.run --alg=her --env=<environment> --num_timesteps=0 --load_path=<filepath> --play" to see the environment.

Example: To run FetchSlideball-v1, use "python -m baselines.run --alg=her --env=FetchSlideball-v1 --num_timesteps=0 --load_path=./Experiments/FetchSlideball-v1_training/250k-2env-10c/fetchslide-250k-2env-10c --play"
