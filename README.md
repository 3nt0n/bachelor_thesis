My bachelor thesis on motion control of robotic arms

Here I am trying to keep track of what I am doing and structuring the Bachelor's Thesis





## TODO

make own environment:

-figure out how to get the xml-files and the python code from the other fetch environments
-put them in an own repository somehow 

### get stuff
 xml file in gym/envs/robotics/assets/fetch
 python code in gym/envs/robotics/fetch





TODO today:

- note standard parameters.
- change parameters to double, triple distance and try to train fetchslide somehow
- create some kind of basket and put the goal in the air
- check out other types of baselines algorithms
