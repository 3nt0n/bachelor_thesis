My bachelor thesis on motion control of robotic arms

DEADLINE for submitting bachelor_thesis: 15.February 2020

Here I am trying to keep track of what I am doing and structuring the Bachelor's Thesis


I'm trying to keep Learning Notes, but they might be incomplete and not 100% correct, I will make them correct until the April

My experiments can be found in Experiments.


If you have any questions or need help with anything, feel free to ask me.


## TODO

- note standard parameters.
- change parameters to double, triple distance and try to train fetchslide somehow
- create some kind of basket and put the goal in the air
- check out other types of baselines algorithms
