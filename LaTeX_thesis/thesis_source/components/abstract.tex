Heterogeneous computing systems consisting of CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs currently suffer from a comparatively low bandwidth and high latency for data transfers between the GPU and the FPGA.
So far, no standard or vendor-provided method exists for direct communication between these two devices.
Indirect communication with a round-trip via the CPU is required.

This thesis enables this missing link over the PCIe bus for use with the popular high performance computing platform OpenCL.

As expected, a significant increase in bandwidth has been achieved.
However, only the direction from the FPGA to the GPU could be realized.
More investigation or a different approach is still required to enable the opposite direction as well.
