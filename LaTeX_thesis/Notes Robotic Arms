most common use: manufactoring -> automatic, precise repititive motions. For tasks, that are hard, dangerous and boring to humans. 

consists of segments connected by joints. Number of joints -> Degrees of Freedom.
Step motors at each joint to rotate -> very precise

job is to move the end effector (hand) to some place.

motion is done by a handheld controller which is stored and then repeated.
