## Mujoco

#### Mujoco License

Get a test license (30-days) first

https://www.roboti.us/license.html

**(Test first if everythong works and only get the student license (free) after 30 days if everything worked.)**


# Mujoco Download

Download the newest Mujoco https://www.roboti.us/index.html

Make a new folder ~/.mujoco and put extract the downloaded Mujoco Folder inside it

Put the mjkex.txt (your license) in the right folder (I am not sure where you have to put it, I copied and put it everywhere)
