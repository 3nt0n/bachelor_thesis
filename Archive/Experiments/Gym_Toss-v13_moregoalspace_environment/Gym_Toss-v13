0,01 weight of ball
toss-v3, but goal space is also including fetchpickplace

edit gym/gym/envs/__init__.py: add the environment to register it
edit gym/gym/envs/robotics/__init__.py: import needed fetch environments

insert gym/gym/envs/robotics/assets/fetch/toss3.xml: same as pickplace, but with ball, better box wall
insert gym/gym/envs/robotics/fetch/toss3.py: same as pickplace

edit baselines/baselines/run.py: add environment to let baselines know that it is used with the robotics environment
