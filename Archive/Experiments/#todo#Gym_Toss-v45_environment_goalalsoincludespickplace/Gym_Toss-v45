**Own files I put in gym**
this is v4, but done right


edit gym/gym/envs/__init__.py: add the environment to register it
edit gym/gym/envs/robotics/__init__.py: import needed fetch environments

insert gym/gym/envs/robotics/assets/fetch/toss45.xml: same as pickplace, but with ball, better box wall
insert gym/gym/envs/robotics/fetch/toss45.py: same as pickplace

edit baselines/baselines/run.py: add environment to let baselines know that it is used with the robotics environment
