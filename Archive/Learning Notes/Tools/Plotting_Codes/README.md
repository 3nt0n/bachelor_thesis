Changes by me (anton): - The number behind "plot" tell you how many arguments can be taken (-> how many graphs in the plot) 
                       - The resulting plot will be output in the current working directory

                   

How to use:

Example: python ./plot2.py ./fetchslideball-v2-100k-2env-10c-log/ ./fetchslideball-v3-250k-10c-2env-log/
