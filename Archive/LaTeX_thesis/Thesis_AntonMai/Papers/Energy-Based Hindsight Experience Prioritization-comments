Our approach is inspired by the work-energy principle in physics.
We define a trajectory energy function as the sum of the transition energy of
the target object over the trajectory. We hypothesize that replaying episodes
that have high trajectory energy is more effective for reinforcement learning in
robotics. To verify our hypothesis, we designed a framework for hindsight ex-
perience prioritization based on the trajectory energy of goal states. The tra-
jectory energy function takes the potential, kinetic, and rotational energy into
consideration. We evaluate our Energy-Based Prioritization (EBP) approach on
four challenging robotic manipulation tasks in simulation. Our empirical results
show that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms
of both performance and sample-efficiency on all four tasks, without increas-
ing computational time.
