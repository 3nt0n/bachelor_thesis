I assume that you installed gym (and baselines) and it works.

 Example: Making my own environment "Slideball" for the robotics environment collection

 - make gym/gym/envs/robotics/fetch_env_ball.py to change the goal distance, if needed, this needs to be imported/referenced by the next file instead of fetch_env. If you don't change the goal distance, this is not needed

 - make a file gym/gym/envs/robotics/fetch/slideball.py, I copied an existing environment (slide) and changed the parameters, names and references how I needed it

 - make gym/gym/envs/robotics/assets/fetch/slideball.xml, my slideball1.py environment was referencing to the xml-file, and I wanted to change an object to a ball, so I had to make this xml-file

 - Edit gym/gym/envs/__init__.py, this registers your environment

 - Edit gym/gym/envs/robotics/__init__.py. this is also needed


Your environment should be working already. Test your environment by running: 
Terminal:
$ python
...
>>> import gym
>>> env = gym.make("*your environment id (in envs/__init__.py)*")
>>> env.reset()
>>> env.render()

If it doesn't work, the error messages should tell you where you have a mistake in your code (most likely you forgot to change a name somewhere)

 - Edit baselines/baselines/run.py, if you want to run it with baselines.




Also check my Learning Notes or check the gym folder and files, to have a better understanding about the structure of the gym folder.
