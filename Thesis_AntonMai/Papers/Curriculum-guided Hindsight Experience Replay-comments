In this paper, we propose to 1) adaptively select
the failed experiences for replay according to the proximity to true goals and the
curiosity of exploration over diverse pseudo goals, and 2) gradually change the
proportion of the goal-proximity and the diversity-based curiosity in the selection
criteria: we adopt a human-like learning strategy that enforces more curiosity in
earlier stages and changes to larger goal-proximity later. This “Goal-and-Curiosity-
driven Curriculum Learning” leads to “Curriculum-guided HER (CHER)”, which
adaptively and dynamically controls the exploration-exploitation trade-off during
the learning process via hindsight experience selection.
