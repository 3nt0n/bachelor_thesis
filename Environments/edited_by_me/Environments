**Own files I put in gym**

edit gym/gym/envs/__init__.py: add the environment to register it
edit gym/gym/envs/robotics/__init__.py: import needed fetch environments

insert gym/gym/envs/robotics/fetch_<somename>.py:i used the fetch_env.py file and edited the goal location 
insert gym/gym/envs/robotics/assets/fetch/<somename>.xml: copy another xml file and edit it or make one yourself. this is for the physical model of your environment 
insert gym/gym/envs/robotics/fetch/<somename>.py: copy another environment and change the parameters as needed

edit baselines/baselines/run.py: add environment to let baselines know that it is used with the robotics environment




If you just want to run the files, you can put the files I used in the right folders.

Alternatively, you can copy the gym and baselines files I used.
